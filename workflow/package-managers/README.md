# TO DO list:

- [x] Setup `package.json` file and `webpack.config.js`;
- [x] Webpack config should allow to not explicitly write `<script>` and `<style>` tags in `index.html` (Hint: `HtmlWebpackPlugin`);
- [x] Make it works with SCSS using webpack loaders;
- [x] It should allow to write code with ES6 + syntax that will compile to ES5;
- [x] Make it possible to create 2 variants of bundle: development and production (set enviroment varibale for this). Production build should be optimized;
- [x] To run scripts we should able to write `npm run` + command;
- [x] Rewrite your css file/files to scss;
- [ ] Load [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) libarary to toy project, use it where it'll help/minimize code.
